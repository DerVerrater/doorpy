Too much to talk about in a single commit message, so I'm placing it here.

[Sample JSON]
Added a sample cards.json file to test with. Reading from JSON returns a dictionary, and kwargs can be passed to Jinja2 forms as a key:value pair (a dictionary!). 
The code grabs the appropriate sub-dictionary based on the card value input and passes that into the render_template() function. 
	(currently strings, but should be whatever value the reader will enter into the form. Update the JSON to match)

[dictionary to Jinja2 variables]
This means that the keys are available as Jinja2 variable names.
So the {"title" : "AnAlert", ..., ..., } in the JSON gives Jinja2 the variable {{title}} along with all the others in the JSON.
The only trick will be remembering them by name when you build the templates with the {{vars}} for Jinja2.

[Templates in Shambles]
Speaking of which, the templates are a bit of a mess. I don't know how to write them correctly, and their inheritence really 
doens't like the name collisions. I managed to get the title to set, though! I may or may not have clobbered the previous
static title while doing so...

[Some other Cleanup]
Check the door.py file for some #TODO:s. I've hard-coded the cardnumber value because I can't be bothered to retrieve the
form value correctly right now.
Also fix the form value retreival. It doesn't seem to work at all.
